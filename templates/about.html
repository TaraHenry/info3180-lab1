            <p>I am an Electronics and Computer Science student, looking to achieve great heights in the world of innovation.
            I love to dance, play games, hang out with friends and listen to music in my spare time when I am not swallowed by work.
            I am still contemplating what path I would like to take within my field and as such, 
            I am committed to exploring as much as I can so as to not limit myself.</p>
